\end{center}


\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)] Let $O$ be the centre of a watch. We define an $x$-axis along the minute hand and a $z$-axis along the hour hand. In which direction does the $y$-axis point, knowing that it forms a direct orthonormal coordinate system $Oxyz$ with the other two, when the time is 9~am? How about when it's 3~pm?

\item[b)] Knowing that the sun rises East and sets West, is the vector for the Earth's angular velocity oriented from the North Pole to the South Pole, or from the South Pole to the North Pole?
\end{enumerate}
